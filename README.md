### Scanline and Spatial Temporal Map

### Dyanmic Mode Decomposition

Dynamic Mode Decomposition is a data-driven analytic method that integrates Fourier transforms and singular value decomposition (SVD). DMD method was first introduced to extract meaningful spatial-temporal coherent structures that dominate dynamic activities in fluid mechanics. DMD method conducts the eigen-decomposition of spatial-temporal coherent structures, therefore can reduce the dimensions of complex systems efficiently without the loss of accuracy. DMD methods have gained traction in many application areas such as fluid dynamics, video processing, control, epidemiology, and financial models.
