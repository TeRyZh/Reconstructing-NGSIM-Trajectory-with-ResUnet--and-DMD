1. The .fig files display both reconstructed NGSIM trajectory dataset vs original NGSIM trajectory dataset. User can open the plot in Matlab to easily compare the quality improvements.
2. The new NGSIM data fields are the same to the original NGSIM dataset, which covers 1000 ft segment in I-80 area.
3. We updated local Y (Column 6), vehicle velocity (Column 12), acceleration (Column 13), preceeding vehicle (Column 15) and following vehicle (Column 16), space headway (Column 17) and time headway (Column 18).
